			I hope to use my computer engineering degree to build innovative devices such as exoskeletons and robotic assistive technologies. I aspire to be an engineer to build solutions
			and apply them to helping the lives of others. I was previously an Algorithm Developer and Diagram Designer for Scriyb, Laboratory Research Assistant at George Mason University, and Engineering Lead for the ASSIP Inventor's Club. Through these
			experiences, I have been a contributing author on a chapter of a book titled "Learning Engineering for Online Education", invented and patented two online education technologies, researched and built a testing mechanism for human motion, and
			created a device that monitors patient's knees after knee surgery to check for complications such as blood clots or improper gait.</p>

			<p class="w3-justify">These experiences are just the start of my journey as an engineer, and I'm excited to create many other innovations to assist those in need. </p>

					<div class="w3-container">
						<p>At Virginia Tech, I am a founding member of the Juvo SourceAmerica Design Team. The team is comprised of 4 freshman engineering students. The goal of the team is to build devices that assist Blacksburg community members with
							disabilities. Specifically, these devices are designed to help overcome the workplace limitations that may be caused by disabilities in order to help an individual be more productive and efficient at work. On June 24th, 2019 our team
							competed in the SourceAmerica Design Competition, which challenges college students across America to build a device that will help overcome a workplace obstacle for a person with a disability. The top three teams are selected by a
							panel of judges to go to Washington D.C. for the finals event, present their design to members of Congress on Capitol Hill, and compete for first place. The prize for first-place is each member of the team and the individual we helped
							wins a cash prize. Additionally, the represented school also wins $1,000.
							My team was one of the three finalists this year and was awarded First Place for our device, the Clicker Band. The Clicker Band is a wearable mouse band that we made for Tucker Winfrey, a Senior at Virginia Tech studying Building
							Construction. Tucker suffered a C4 spinal cord injury at the beach and became a quadriplegic due to the accident. However, Tucker still has movement of his arms, which allows him to use a trackball mouse by rolling the ball with his
							right wrist and hitting the click pad on the base of the trackball mouse with the same wrist. However, moving his wrist from the ball to the click pad on the base is time consuming and causes soreness. Our invention takes the click
							functionality of the trackball mouse and puts it on a bracelet that Tucker wears on his left wrist while using his trackball with his right hand. Using our invention, Tucker can maneuver the mouse on the screen using the trackball and
							he no longer has to take the time to move his wrist from the ball to the click pad. Instead, he can push the Clicker Band on his left hand against any solid surface to perform a click. Our invention had a very noticeable impact on
							Tuckerâ€™s computer usage, as it reduced the amount of misclicks by approximately 80% and allowed him to navigate 30% faster overall with very little practice.
							Developing devices that can help people with disabilities work has significant meaning not only for those with disabilities, but also the communities that they live in. Our product has the potential to help hundreds of thousands of
							people with similar limitations use computers, leading to a larger amount of people with disabilities who can work, and allowing those with disabilities to perform at levels closer to their peers.
